## Pets

This project was developed for the university and its objective was to implement a CRUD system for handling pets. In this case, a system was designed that allows efficient registration, deletion, updating and listing of pets.

To carry out this project, the Laravel web development framework was used, which provides a solid and organized structure for the development of robust and scalable web applications. Through the implementation of a set of Laravel tools, it was possible to create a functional and easy-to-use application.

The system allows users to register pets with detailed information such as their name, species, breed, age, gender, and other relevant details. In addition, there is the option to delete pets, update their information and list them in a table for easy viewing and management.

In summary, this project demonstrates the ability to use the Laravel framework for the development of complex and useful web applications, allowing the user to efficiently and effectively manage important information about pets.
